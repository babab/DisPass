DisPass
******************************************************************************

DisPass is a password manager for GNU/Linux, \*BSD, MacOS X and Windows.
It can be used as any traditional password manager, but has one key
difference. DisPass does not store your passwords anywhere, so you
can never lose them. It creates strong and unique passphrases formed
from a master password and a label (and some optional parameters),
helping you get rid of the bad habit of using a single password for
multiple websites. Dispass is a console application, but also has a
simple graphical interface.

Quick start
==============================================================================

These are quick instructions for the impatient, just wanting to check
out DisPass. For full documentation on using **DisPass**, visit
http://dispass.org

Download
--------

Download and install DisPass from the Python Package Index with pip:

.. code:: console

   pip install --user dispass


Using DisPass for the first time
--------------------------------

For this example we will create a passphrase to use for a google account.

1. Create and save a label ``google`` to the labelfile:

   .. code:: console

       dispass add google

2. Generate the passphrase for the first time. Since you will need to
   register the passphrase with google we pass the ``--verify`` flag
   or simply ``-v`` so DisPass asks us to verify the password and we
   can avoid typing errors in the input password while creating the
   resulting passphrase for the first time:

   .. code:: console

       dispass generate --verify google


Mini screencast
---------------

Checkout the following mini screencast. In this demo the label is added
interactively.
