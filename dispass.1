.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
dispass [\-f <labelfile>] [\-h] [\-V] <command> [<args>]
.sp
gdispass
.SH SUMMARY
.sp
DisPass is a password manager for GNU/Linux, *BSD, MacOS X and Windows.
It can be used as any traditional password manager, but has one key
difference. DisPass does not store your passwords anywhere, so you
can never lose them. It creates strong and unique passphrases formed
from a master password and a label (and some optional parameters),
helping you get rid of the bad habit of using a single password for
multiple websites. Dispass is a console application, but also has a
simple graphical interface.

.SS Definitions
.sp
Here are some definitions which may help you understand the rest of the
documentation better.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B label
A label is a string that you use to identify the passphrase. This
can be a domain name of the service the passphrase is used for,
e.g. \(aqgoogle.com\(aq.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Since this program asks for a password/passphrase to generate another
password/passphrase, things may get a bit confusing. I\(aqve decided to use the
words \(aqpassword\(aq and \(aqpassphrase\(aq differently and consistent.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B password
Use of the word \(aqpassword\(aq is dedicated to the input password, i.e. the
password you are asked to enter and only you know. Whenever you read
password, this is the one I mean. The password needs to be at least 8
characters long and does not have a maximum length.
.TP
.B passphrase
With \(aqpassphrase\(aq I always mean the output passphrase, i.e. the passphrase
that is unique and generated from a label, password and sequence number.
Generated passphrases are 30 characters long. The length can be optionally
changed.
.UNINDENT
.SS Labelfile
.sp
DisPass does not store your passwords or passphrases, but it does store
labels and their settings (algorithm, length and sequence_number) for
convenience. However, please keep in mind that you should try to name
labels in a way that you can easily \(aqdispass generate\(aq a passphrase on
any computer/device that has DisPass at any given moment without having
your labelfile at hand.
.sp
When dispass is run without arguments it will try to find a labelfile.
The location of this file varies and depends on the platform type you use,
the file flag and the environment variables that may be set:
.sp
You can override the location of the labelfile using the
\fB\-f <labelfile>, \-\-file=<labelfile>\fP flag. This can be a way for you
to use different sets of labels/passphrases with a different \(aqmaster\(aq
password for each set.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
If \-f flag is given, that value is used.
.IP 2. 3
If environment var DISPASS_LABELFILE is set, that value is used.
.IP 3. 3
If environment var XDG_DATA_HOME is set,
\fB$XDG_DATA_HOME/dispass/labels\fP is used.
.IP 4. 3
If none of the above applies, the labelfile will default to the following
locations:
.INDENT 3.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBGNU/Linux and Mac OS X\fP: \fB~/.dispass/labels\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fB*BSD and other Unixen\fP: \fB~/.dispass/labels\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBWindows\fP:   \fBC:\eUsers\e<username>\edispass\elabels\fP

.SS Basic usage
.sp
You can start using dispass for e.g. google.com like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
dispass generate google.com
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The passphrases created are 30 characters long by default, but some
websites may not validate such a long passphrase or you might want to
make it even longer. You can easily set a desired passphrase length
using the \fB\-l\fP flag. Hotmail passwords are limited to 16 characters:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
dispass generate \-l 16 hotmail
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Generating passphrases for multiple labels is just as easy:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
dispass generate google hotmail YaHo0 "P0551bly*a81t)H4rd2rmbr"
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Labels are case\-sensitive and digits and special characters can be used.
You should try to name labels in a way that you can easily generate a
passphrase on any computer/device that has DisPass at any given moment.
.SS Label specifications
.sp
While the above works fine without storing any information, you are
encouraged to store your labels in a labelfile for convenience. That
way, you don\(aqt have to use the \fB\-l 16\fP option everytime you create
your hotmail password.
.sp
Labels have a specification that consists of the following parameters:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
length (the length of the passphrase)
.IP \(bu 2
algorithm (the algorithm to use)
.IP \(bu 2
sequence number (not used in default algorithm)
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fBlabelspec\fP looks like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
label[:size[:algorithm[:sequence_number]]]
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Adding a label
.sp
You can save a new \fBhotmail\fP label with a length of 16 and generate the
passphrase in one go:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
dispass add \-g hotmail:16
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The next time you generate a passphrase for \fBhotmail\fP using:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
dispass generate hotmail
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
it will return the same passphrase as before (with a length of 16
characters).
.SS Incrementing sequence numbers
.sp
You might want to change the passphrase you enter into some system.
Of course, you can do this simply by using a different label, e.g.:
\fBHotmail\fP or \fBhotmail\-2\fP\&. You don\(aqt have to though.
.sp
DisPass supports dealing with this situation in the \fIdispass2\fP algorithm.
It basically gives you an option of \fIbumping\fP a passphrase by simply
incrementing a \fBsequence number\fP\&.
.sp
To use sequence numbers with the hotmail label from before you can
update it to use the dispass2 algorithm with sequence number 1:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
dispass update hotmail 16:dispass2:1
dispass generate hotmail
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The next time you want to use a different passphrase, you can simply use
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
dispass increment hotmail
dispass generate hotmail
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Using gdispass
.sp
You can start using gDisPass by running the \fBgdispass\fP executable.
Fill in a name for the label that you can easily remember.
.sp
To generate a passphrase for a new label, i.e. a label that you have
never used before, check the appropriate checkbox. This will allow you
to enter the (master) password twice. gDisPass will then compare the
passwords to see if they are the same. This is needed to minimize the
risk of typos. It is advised that you check the box everytime you
create a passphrase for a new label.
.sp
Subsequential generation of passphrases for the same label most probably do
not need this check. You will likely be warned when/if you made a typo by
the system or website you want to authenticate for.
.sp
If you correctly entered a label and password, you can generate the
passphrase by pressing <Return> or by clicking the appropriate button.
The resulting passphrase will be focused and selected. On platforms
that support it (e.g. *BSD or GNU/Linux) the passphrase will be
automatically placed into your copy/paste buffer.
.sp
Resetting all fields when you are done or when you need to quickly
cancel the generation (because someone is watching over your
shoulders) can be done by pressing <Escape> or by clicking the
appropriate button.
