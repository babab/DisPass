DisPass is a passphrase generator for Windows and Unix / Linux.
You can use it to create unique passwords for logging in to websites, servers
or any other kind of thing that requires login.
DisPass does not keep your passwords in a database but rather lets you
generate a unique passphrase formed from a master password and a label.
It is a command line app, but also has a simple graphical interface.
