DisPass
=======

DisPass is a password manager for GNU/Linux, \*BSD, MacOS X and Windows.
It can be used as any traditional password manager, but has one key
difference. DisPass does not store your passwords anywhere, so you
can never lose them. It creates strong and unique passphrases formed
from a master password and a label (and some optional parameters),
helping you get rid of the bad habit of using a single password for
multiple websites. Dispass is a console application, but also has a
simple graphical interface.
