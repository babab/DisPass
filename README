What is it?
-----------
DisPass is a cross-platform password generator that comes with both
a Command Line Interface and a Guided User Interface.
You can use it to create unique passwords for logging in to websites, servers
or any other kind of thing that requires login.

It doesn't keep your passwords in a database but rather lets you generate
the same password formed from parameters that are more easily remembered
by people.

These parameters are:
 * The label

   The label is a string that you use to identify the password.
   i.e. this can be a domainname of the service the password is used for
   like 'google.com'.

 * The salt (optional)

   The salt can be a string or file that you can optionally use to add as a 
   parameter for the generation of the password.

 * The master password

   This is a master password you use to generate the password valid for the
   setted label.
