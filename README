DisPass is a passphrase generator for Windows and Unix / Linux.
You can use it to create unique passwords for logging in to websites, servers
or any other kind of thing that requires login.
DisPass does not keep your passwords in a database but rather lets you
generate a unique passphrase formed from a master password and a label.
It is a command line app, but also has a simple graphical interface.

 * label

   The label is a string that you use to identify the password.
   i.e. this can be a domainname of the service the password is used for
   like 'google.com'.

 * password

   This is a master password that, together with the label is used to generate
   the passphrase.


-------------------
Downloading DisPass
-------------------
DisPass is distributed in three flavors:

 1. The complete package with the DisPass python module, setup and
    runner scripts and files needed for building the
    (multilingual) documentation

 2. Single python module (dispass.py)

 3. Freezed application

    DisPass, the Python interpreter and all dependencies freezed into
    one executable file. Bigger filesize, but useful on systems without
    a supported version of Python.

You can download the files from this page:

 * https://bitbucket.org/babab/dispass/downloads

For the latest development version of DisPass, download:

 * https://bitbucket.org/babab/dispass/get/tip.zip (zip)
 * https://bitbucket.org/babab/dispass/get/tip.tar.gz (gz)
 * https://bitbucket.org/babab/dispass/get/tip.tar.bz2 (bz2)


-----------------------
Installing (Unix/Linux)
-----------------------
There are multiple ways of using dispass and also several options on how
and where to place the files of dispass on your system.

 * If Python 2.5 or higher is installed on your system

   1. Installing with the use of Python's distutils

      Download the latest version from
      https://bitbucket.org/babab/dispass/downloads
      Extract the archive and cd to the dispass folder.
      Now run 'python setup.py install'
      This will install the dispass module in python's dist-packages folder.
      You can now run dispass using the 'dispass' and 'gdispass' scripts
      placed under '/usr/local/bin/' or '/usr/bin/'.

   2. Manual install to /usr/local/bin or a different directory

      The file 'dispass.py' is a single python module and it is the only file
      you really need to use dispass. You can manually copy it to /home/bin/ or
      /usr/local/bin/ and give it exec rights with chmod.

 * If Python is not installed on your system / Freezed application

---------------------------------------
Usage::

   DisPass 0.1a6(posix) - http://babab.nl/p/dispass

   When DisPass is executed as 'gdispass' or 'dispass -g',
   the graphical version will be started.

   USAGE: dispass [-co] label [label2] [label3] [...]
          dispass -g | -h | -V
          gdispass

   Options:
   -c, --create    use if this passphrase is new (check input PW)
   -g, --gui       start guided graphical version of DisPass
   -h, --help      show this help and exit
   -o, --output    output passphrases to stdout (instead of the
                   more secure way of displaying via curses)
   -V, --version   show full version information and exit


------------------------------------
Using the command line app (Windows)
------------------------------------
Usage::

   DisPass 0.1a6(nt) - http://babab.nl/p/dispass

   When DisPass is started without arguments, the graphical
   version will be started. To use the command line,
   submit one or more labels.

   USAGE: dispass [options] [label] [label2] [label3] [...]

   Options:
   -c, --create    use if this passphrase is new (check input PW)
   -h, --help      show this help and exit
   -V, --version   show full version information and exit
