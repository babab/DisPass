What is it?
-----------
DisPass is a cross-platform passphrase generator that comes with both
a Command Line Interface and a Guided User Interface.
You can use it to create unique passwords for logging in to websites, servers
or any other kind of thing that requires login.

It doesn't keep your passwords in a database but rather lets you generate
a unique passphrase formed from a master password and a label.

 * label

   The label is a string that you use to identify the password.
   i.e. this can be a domainname of the service the password is used for
   like 'google.com'.

 * password

   This is a master password that, together with the label is used to generate 
   the passphrase.
